# Project Architecture
This document outlines the architecture for a web scraping application designed to automate the downloading, reformatting, and local storage of website documentation for personal reference. The application brings together a user-friendly GUI developed with Tauri, a Rust backend for efficient data processing, a Puppeteer web scraping component for downloading sites, and LLM technology for intelligent content analysis and reformatting. Core functionalities include downloading a website, reformatting the rendered data with LLM technology, and saving and accessing the reformatted data.
Components:
Puppeteer Scraper: Executes in a Node.js environment, responsible for navigating to specified URLs, performing dynamic web scraping, and returning the HTML content. Should be modular and easily deployable both locally and on a server.
Rust Application: Acts as a client, making requests to the Puppeteer scraper for HTML content, then processes this content using LLM technology for advanced formatting into a Markdown-like format. This component also handles communication via WebSocket protocol.
WebSocket Server: Facilitates bi-directional communication between the Rust application and Puppeteer scraper. Required to handle complex data structures efficiently.
LLM Technology through OpenAI API: Utilized by the Rust application for enhanced content formatting and processing.
Communication Protocol:
The Rust application communicates with the Puppeteer scraper via the WebSocket protocol. This protocol is chosen for its efficiency in handling real-time, bi-directional communication, and its ability to manage complex data structures.
Request-Response Model: The Rust client sends a JSON formatted request containing the URL(s) to be scraped. The Puppeteer scraper processes this request and responds with the dynamically rendered HTML content.
Data Types and Structuring: Considering the goals for reformatting, the Rust application should request specific HTML elements or sections beneficial for LLM processing. This might include headings, paragraphs, and metadata (like title and description tags).
Future Integration with a Flask Web Application:
The architecture is designed with scalability and future integration in mind. The WebSocket server makes it straightforward to extend the system to interact with a Flask application for similar scraping tasks. The key is to maintain a consistent communication protocol and data format across all components.
Documentation and Error Handling:
Puppeteer Scraper: Thorough documentation covering available routes, request formats, and potential errors is critical. Implement robust error handling to manage timeouts, unreachable URLs, and rendering issues.
Rust Application: Document the data processing logic, including LLM usage guidelines and error handling strategies for issues such as network failures or invalid data from the scraper.
Infrastructure Considerations:
Initially, the Puppeteer scraper operates on a local machine. For server deployment, consider using containerization for ease of deployment and scalability. Monitoring and logging are essential for maintaining the systemâ€™s health.

Outcome Expectations:
Clear Communication Flow: The architecture aims for a clear and efficient request-response flow between the Rust client and Puppeteer scraper via WebSocket, ensuring real-time data transfer.
Scalable System Design: The system design facilitates future expansions, including different kinds of data requests and integration with additional technologies or web applications.
Robust Error Handling and Documentation: Essential for long-term maintenance, ease of integration, and developer onboarding.
