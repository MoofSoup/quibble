# **Session Report**

- **Date:** 2/25/2024
- **Pomodoros:** 3
- **Objectives:** Create a design document for the Scraper Component project.

### **Version Control for the Design Process:**

**Challenge Summary:** I want a system for creating and archiving documentation

**Attempt 1: Google docs**

- **Summary:** I used google docs to paste generations from chatGPT, write my own design documents, and save them for later reading
- **Outcome:** The writing process did not produce clear results, and I ended up with a large running notepad with a bunch of random ideas
- **Reflection:** Google Docs does not have the archiving features necessary to create documentation. All its good for is making the documents themselves, but it doesn't even integrate well. Maybe I could look for a google docs plugin that saves markdown to git, but thats a tangent for a different time

**Attempt 2: Markdown in vscode with Github**

- **Summary:** I looked for a workflow using vscode to edit markdown. I looked into various visual markdown editing extensions.
- **Outcome:** The default vscode markdown integration proved sufficient, I may look for an enhanced preview extensions or visual markdown editing extensions again later.
- **Reflection:** Markdown in vscode, versioned on Git, seems like a very stable and well reasoned procedure for writing and maintaining design documents, even at scale with large teams.

**Conclusion:** Creating a design document for my scraper project led me down a tangent of procedure, one which I will surely apply to the rest of the Quibble project. I dont believe I wasted time, because I feel like I have worked out a minor yet omnipresent roadblock in my design process.
