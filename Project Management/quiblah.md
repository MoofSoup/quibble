I need to write about Quibble !!
Quibble is really cute and sexy !! I luv it sm <33
obsidian is vs code shaped, I want quibble to be arc shaped!! Having an explorer *and* tabs is REDUNDANT!!!. I dont rly like redundancy. So, that means i need to find a way to do all the nav stuff that obsidian and vs code SHUV into their left sidebar elsewhere in the app :(. Bottom nav bars work if they are only the bottom bar of a sub context. If a bottom bar spans the main context of the app, it contends with the system toolbar. 

bottom bars work for application controls. In spotify, the bottom bar holds pause, play, skip, etc. In discord, there is a small bottom bar in the channels browser, and there is a floating bottom bar next to it for typing in a message. 

Top bars are not good for anything ever
