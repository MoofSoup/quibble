User Requirements Specification (URS) for Quibble

1. **Introduction**
   Quibble is an innovative, AI-assisted text editor designed to enhance user workflow by organizing, sorting, and searching conversations with various Large Language Models (LLMs). The application aims to facilitate prompt engineering best practices and allow users to customize their virtual environments. Quibble targets researchers, developers, and enthusiasts working with LLMs, providing them with a streamlined and efficient tool for managing their interactions and optimizing their prompt engineering workflows.

2. **Project Goals and Objectives**
   - Enable users to organize, sort, and search their conversation history with LLMs effectively.
   - Provide a customizable user environment to support individual preferences and workflows.
   - Facilitate the development and sharing of prompt engineering best practices among users.
   - Offer a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with LLMs and easy management of conversation history.

3. **Functional Requirements**
   - Support editing of .md and .txt documents within the application.
   - Allow users to send messages to LLMs and receive responses within the application interface.
   - Store and manage conversation history, including metadata such as timestamps, LLM model information, and user-defined tags.
   - Provide search functionality to quickly locate specific conversations or prompts based on keywords, tags, or other relevant criteria.
   - Enable users to customize their virtual environment, including color schemes, fonts, and layout preferences.
   - Allow users to create, edit, and manage prompt templates for efficient reuse and sharing.
   - Provide import and export functionality for conversation history and prompt templates to facilitate collaboration and backup.

4. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Build the application layer using a finite state machine architecture, leveraging Rust's enums for persistent state management.
   - Ensure the application can handle concurrent API requests efficiently and reliably.
   - Implement secure API key management, protecting user credentials and sensitive information.
   - Design a modular application architecture to facilitate scalability and future adaptation for web-based deployment.
   - Optimize application performance to minimize latency and resource consumption during user interactions with LLMs.

5. **User Experience (UX) and Design Expectations**
   - Minimize the number of clicks required for users to perform core workflows, such as sending messages and accessing conversation history.
   - Ensure core buttons and features are easily visible and accessible within the user interface.
   - Employ a consistent and intuitive design language throughout the application to facilitate user understanding and navigation.
   - Provide access to advanced features and settings without cluttering the main user interface, using contextual menus or dedicated settings pages.
   - Implement responsive design principles to ensure a seamless experience across different screen sizes and devices.

6. **System and Integration Requirements**
   - Ensure compatibility with major desktop operating systems, including macOS, Windows, and Linux, by leveraging the Tauri framework.
   - Integrate with popular LLM APIs, such as OpenAI's GPT models, to enable seamless communication between the application and the language models.
   - Provide a flexible and extensible architecture to accommodate future integrations with additional LLM providers or custom models.

7. **Future Scalability and Enhancements**
   - Plan for the inclusion of a markdown editor to facilitate the creation and formatting of content within the application.
   - Explore the integration of Git functionality to enable version control and collaboration features for prompt templates and conversation history.
   - Consider the development of cloud-based and on-premises enterprise solutions to expand the Quibble ecosystem and cater to organizational needs.

8. **Constraints and Assumptions**
   - The application will be developed using Rust and the Tauri framework, assuming the availability of required development tools and resources.
   - The initial release will focus on desktop platforms, with the assumption that future versions may expand to web-based deployment.
   - The application will rely on third-party LLM APIs, assuming their availability, stability, and adherence to their respective terms of service.
   - Development timelines and resources will be constrained by the availability of the development team and any budgetary limitations.
