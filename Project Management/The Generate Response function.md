- where do I want to handle data access in order to maintain separation of concerns?
	 - instantiate a conversation
	 - check out a thread
- When is a thread going to be checked out?
	- a thread needs to be checked out so that it can be passed into the get_response method
- how will the application state controller handle talking to the apis?
- **list of functions the app controller needs to call**
	- get response
- how do I know that the conversation being displayed is the most up to date conversation?
- what functions would the application layer call in order to load a conversation?
- how does a user message update the database?
- when a user sends a message:
	- what is sent to rust is a bunch of html. 
	- This html is serialized into a series of message objects
	- The ConversationData struct is updated, which simultaneously updates the database. 
	- The correct thread is passed into the get_response function
	- when the get_response function is resolved, the ConversationData struct is updated, which simultaneously updates the database
	- the current thread is then serialized to html, and sent back to Javascript as a string
- The generate response function is a method defined on the trait AIAssistant. It takes a mutable reference to the current active thread in a conversation, and after it returns the thread.
