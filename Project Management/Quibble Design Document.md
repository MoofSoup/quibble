## Introduction

Quibble is an innovative, local, AI-assisted text editor designed to streamline and enhance writing workflows through a seamless integration of cutting-edge technologies. This document outlines the comprehensive design plan for Quibble, covering its architecture, technology stack, and detailed considerations for each layer of the application. Our design philosophy emphasizes modularity, performance, security, and scalability, laying a strong foundation for both current functionalities and future enhancements.

### UI Layer

#### Prototyping Approach

Quibble's frontend employs Tauri, which allows us to build lightweight and secure desktop applications using web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. For the prototyping phase, we will use basic JavaScript and CSS to construct the user interface, particularly focusing on the capability to manage multiple persistent tabs efficiently.

**Modular Design Consideration:**

- **Tabs Management:** Implement a dynamic tabs system that allows users to open, close, and switch between different markdown files effortlessly. This requires a tab control system built with JavaScript that interacts seamlessly with the backend for file management.
- **Interactivity:** Placeholder components for AI interactions and version control functionalities will be outlined, ensuring that these components can be further expanded or modified without extensive restructuring.

### Application Layer

#### State Management

In Quibble, the Rust backend plays a critical role in state management, particularly in handling the states related to file operations and AI interactions. Using Rust's `enum` types, we accurately represent the application's various states.

**Schema for State Management:**

- **File Operations:** Enums to represent states like `FileOpened`, `FileClosed`, `FileEdited`, and `FileVersionControlled`.
- **AI Interactions:** Enums for states including `AIIdle`, `AIProcessing`, `AICompleted`, and `AIError`.

These enums facilitate handling the complexity of user actions and backend processes, making state transitions predictable and manageable.

### Business Logic Layer

#### OpenAI API Integration

The core of Quibble's AI functionality lies in its ability to interact with OpenAI's API, which will be handled using Rust's asynchronous programming capabilities, specifically leveraging the `reqwest` crate for HTTP requests.

**Concurrent HTTP Requests:**

- The actor model will be utilized, via frameworks such as `actix`, to manage concurrent API calls efficiently, ensuring that the application remains responsive even when loading content from OpenAI's servers.
- Strategies for managing these concurrent requests will include prioritizing user-initiated actions and implementing sophisticated error handling and retry mechanisms.

### Data Access and Database Layer

Quibble will use PostgreSQL for storing AI chat histories and project-specific data, leveraging Rust's `sqlx` crate for type-safe SQL queries and robust data access patterns.

**Preliminary Database Design:**

- Considering the integration with Google's Gemini API in the future, the database schema will be designed to accommodate a flexible and extensible data model, ensuring that we can easily adapt to new data types or structures required by additional APIs.
- The database will initially support tables for `Projects`, `Files`, `AIInteractions`, and `VersionHistory`, with room for expansion as new features are developed.

### Concurrency and Scalability

<strong>Actor Model for Managing Concurrent Operations:</strong>

- The application will heavily utilize the actor model to ensure that concurrent operations, especially HTTP requests to OpenAI or other services, do not block the user interface or lead to performance bottlenecks.
- **Scalability Considerations:** As user numbers grow, careful management of API request rates and adherence to OpenAI's usage terms will be crucial. Implementing a caching system for frequently requested AI responses could mitigate potential over-dependence on live API calls.

### Security and Privacy

**Key Security Concerns:**

- **Data Storage:** Implement encrypted storage for sensitive data, particularly AI interaction histories and user project data.
- **API Interactions:** Utilize secure authentication methods and ensure that API keys or sensitive credentials are not exposed in the client-side code.

### Technology Stack Confirmation

- **Backend Development:** Rust, chosen for its performance, safety, and concurrency features.
- **Frontend Interaction:** Tauri, enabling a high-performance and secure bridge between the desktop environment and web-based UI.
- **Serialization/Deserialization:** `serde`, for efficient handling of JSON data structures, particularly important for config files and communication with APIs.
- **HTTP Requests:** `reqwest`, supporting asynchronous operations and robust error handling for interacting with external APIs.

### Future Considerations

**Design Principles for Scalability and Enhancements:**

- **Flexibility:** Adopting modular design patterns allows for easy inclusion of new features or adjustments to existing functionalities based on user feedback.
- **State Management:** Utilizing Rust's type system, particularly enums for application state management, contributes to minimizing bugs and enhancing the application's overall reliability.
