**Overview** Quibble is a local, AI-assisted text editor designed to enhance writing workflows. It integrates advanced AI functionalities via API calls, offering features like markdown editing, versioning with Git, customizable AI prompts, and more. The project leverages Rust for backend development and Tauri for bridging web technology-based frontend interfaces.

**Architecture**

- The application runs locally, targeting a standalone user environment.
- Backend developed in Rust, focusing on performance and security.
- Frontend deployed via Tauri, employing basic JavaScript and CSS for prototyping stages.

**Project Initialization and Structure**

- On launch, Quibble prompts for file or folder opening. Automatically recognizes or establishes Quibble projects within the directory.
- Projects involve a hidden directory for config data in JSON and optionally a custom .gitignore,  a local Git repository.
- Markdown files are stored within project directories, while AI chat histories are maintained in a local database.

**Version Control Integration**

- Utilizes Git for versioning on a per-project basis. Integration specifics, including library selection, are deferred to a later decision point.

**AI Integration**

- Backend to make API calls to OpenAI, using publicly available Rust bindings.
- AI interactions, including conversations and prompts, are stored and managed locally, with database design mirroring OpenAI's API structure.

**Concurrency and Scalability**

- Designed for individual use with capability for each user to have separate project directories and Git repos. Scalability beyond local use will maintain this isolated approach.

**Security and Privacy**

- Specific measures and protocols to be determined. The document will highlight the importance of implementing robust security measures, especially for local data storage and API interactions.

**Backend Services and API Integration**

- Essential backend functionalities include handling AI API calls, project management, file and version control, and local database management for AI chat history.
- Direct interaction with the OpenAI API through Rust bindings, with additional backend services designed to support Quibble’s core features.

**Logging and Monitoring**

- Strategies for logging and monitoring backend operations are to be established, emphasizing the need for efficient error handling and performance tracking.

**Testing and Quality Assurance**

- Plans for testing backend functionalities and overall application integrity remain to be formalized. Emphasis will be on ensuring reliability and usability, particularly concerning unique AI and version control features.

**Future Considerations**

- While immediate focus is on establishing a robust and functional local application, future revisions may explore enhancements based on user feedback and technological advancements.
