1. Enhanced Conversation Organization:
    - Implement a "Branch Conversation" feature that allows users to create a new branch from any message in the conversation history.
    - Provide a visual representation of the conversation tree, displaying the main thread and its branches.
    - Allow users to easily switch between branches and the main thread using a dropdown menu or a tree-like navigation panel.
    - Introduce a "Merge Branch" feature that enables users to merge a branch back into the main thread at any point, preserving the context and flow of the conversation.
    - Offer a "Collapse Branch" option to hide branches from view, keeping the main thread clutter-free.
2. Integrated Document Editor:
    - Seamlessly integrate a markdown-compatible document editor within the Quibble interface.
    - Provide a split-screen view, with the conversation history on one side and the document editor on the other.
    - Allow users to quickly switch between the conversation and the document editor using keyboard shortcuts or a toggle button.
    - Implement a "Send to LLM" button within the document editor, allowing users to send selected text or the entire document to the LLM for analysis or generation.
    - Automatically save the document at regular intervals and provide a manual "Save" button for user-initiated saves.
3. Prompt Engineering Augmentation:
    - Create a "Prompt Library" feature that allows users to save, organize, and reuse prompt templates.
    - Implement a tagging system for prompt templates, enabling users to categorize them based on their purpose, LLM compatibility, or other custom criteria.
    - Provide a "Prompt Builder" tool that offers a visual interface for constructing complex prompts using predefined building blocks and user-defined variables.
    - Allow users to set default prompt templates for different LLMs, ensuring a consistent experience across multiple models.
    - Implement a strategy pattern to handle the specific requirements and formatting of different LLMs, abstracting the complexity from the user.
4. Streamlined Archiving and Sharing:
    - Introduce a "Conversation Archive" feature that automatically saves completed conversations, along with their metadata (timestamps, LLM model, tags).
    - Provide a "Share Conversation" button that generates a shareable link or exports the conversation in a standard format (e.g., JSON, Markdown) for easy sharing via email or other platforms.
    - Allow users to set access permissions for shared conversations, controlling who can view or edit the content.
    - Implement a "Shared Prompt Library" where users can publish and discover prompt templates created by the community, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.
5. Optional Git Integration and Additional Settings:
    - Include a "Git Integration" toggle in the application settings, allowing users to enable or disable the feature as needed.
    - When enabled, automatically initialize a local Git repository for the user's prompt templates and conversation history.
    - Provide a simplified Git interface within Quibble, allowing users to commit changes, create branches, and manage versions of their prompt templates and conversations.
    - Offer a "Sync with Remote" option to push and pull changes from a remote Git repository, facilitating collaboration and backup.
    - Ensure that the Git integration is unobtrusive and does not interfere with the core functionality of Quibble for users who choose not to use it.

By implementing these core workflows, Quibble can provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for managing conversations, editing documents, and leveraging prompt engineering best practices. The application will cater to the diverse needs of researchers, developers, and enthusiasts while maintaining a consistent and streamlined interface. The optional Git integration and customizable settings allow users to tailor Quibble to their specific requirements, ensuring a flexible and adaptable tool for interacting with LLMs.
