# **Session Report**

- **Date:** 2/26/24
- **Pomodoros:** 3
- **Objectives:** sync local git repo w repo on github

### **Git Push failing:**

**Challenge Summary:** Last night, I made a bunch of changes locally, and I successfully committed them to my local repo. However, when I went to github they didn't show up\[ :( \]. So, I needed to learn about git in order to understand what the problem was, as well as how its called in git-speak.

**Attempt 1: Using chatGPT**

- **Summary:** In order to solve my problem with chatGPT, first I used Annalise (prompt engineering assistant) to generate a prompt. The prompt I generated included a snippet of git's output logs, additional context (that I didn't know git, that git was successfully installed and the local repo was working right, etc. as well as a request for the promptee LLM to generate detailed instructions for a begginer who doesn't use git. Then, I fed the generated prompt into Sara (coding assistant), who successfully diagnosed the problem.

- **Outcome:** \[Describe the result\]
- **Reflection:** \[Reflect on this attempt\]

**Conclusion:**
