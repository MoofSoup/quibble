### **Introduction: Modeling Intuitive Behaviors:**
In the year 2024, the internet is becoming an increasingly user hostile place. Websites are becoming SEO hellscapes, and the design of desktop apps has become less and less relevant as our phones become our digital lives. As a person who spends maybe 30% of her life behind a desktop screen, I am constantly suffering from poorly designed apps. In a world with a million ways to settle, I believe UX is the most important factor for constructing my digital experience.

As a programmer, I approach application design from a stateful perspective: An application is fundamentally a collection of states and transitions, and from each state different transitions are available. The concept of workflows I have landed at allows me to think about UX in a way that translates quite nicely to stateful programming!

In Quibble, I aim to harness the concept of workflows in order model the ways in which I already find myself interacting with LLMs. Workflows are not specific to an application: In my day to day, I already have workflows for making and archiving prompts. I aim to use the concept of workflows to first codify my prompt engineering habits, and then make from the ground up a software that allows me to iron out all the wrinkles I am constantly rubbing against

### **Workflows: Quibble's Conceptual Heart**
Broadly speaking, a workflow is a series of tasks necessary to achieve a goal. In Quibble, a workflow might be something as simple as "create a new chat window", or it might be something as complex as "archive a tangent that you went on in order to answer a prerequisite question, so that you can go back to your original topic without clogging the LLM's Context Window". Both of these workflows can be used in order to accomplish goals that are within Quibbles scope. In the first, A common goal a user of Quibble might have that Quibble aims to solve is "Talk to an LLM~!" In the second, the end user might have the goal of "I dont want to forget what the LLM said but I have a different question!!"

If Quibble is a factory that solves problems, workflows are like the machines that modify the problem in some way. The end user is like a conveyor belt, taking the problem from one workflow to the next

Quibble is like a factory that solves problems. The end user is like a worker on the factory line, and the workflows are like various machines that reshape the problem. Solving a problem at the quibble factory is a feedback loop between machines that modify the problem, and the end user that takes attempts at solving it. 

Workflows are tools that the user uses to manage their own project. They are the medium through which the end user communicates with their second brain!
