**Workflow:** A workflow is a streamlined and intuitive sequence of user actions that modifies the application state in order to achieve a goal oriented task. The workflows necessary to achieve common goals must be readily accessible. Workflows must be located either in a logical toolbar, or within the view of the state that they modify. 

**Goal:**
If, for example, an end user has a goal: Use ChatGPT to research all the Rust Crates that can be used in order to run an audio engine on an esp32, there will be some tasks they must do in order to achieve that goal. 

**Tasks:**
- create a new chat tab that is correctly named
- create an effective prompt for the chat
- bounce ideas off the AI through a chat format, going on tangents when one off questions need to be answered
- archive any valuable information in a design document iff applicable.
**Workflows:**
- click the new chat icon in the top navbar. Upon open, the name section of the chat will be highlighted, encouraging the user to modify it. If the end user does not give a name, after a few messages the chat will automatically be named by the AI.
- The end user can either write up their own effective prompt within the message window, can use one of quibbles smart assistants to make the prompt in a thread, or can make a new conversation and do their prompt engineering in there
- the user can take advantage of the context specific workflows for managing threads in order to have archived, non linear conversations with the LLM
- The user can use the New Document icon to make a new document, the new folder icon in order to make a new folder, and can create and sort documents within quibble!
As in this example, the end user's goal is within the scope of Quibble, the workflows the end user must use in order to reach their goal must be easily accessible within quibble. 

A workflow is a streamlined and intuitive sequence of user actions designed to achieve specific tasks. These tasks are fragments of larger goals that are chained together by the end user. By labeling the most common tasks as workflows, we can ensure that all the buttons that are easily accessible are the ones that the user needs, and all the buttons the user needs are equally accessible. Labeling tasks that can be chained together to achieve goals as workflows allows us to think of the UX of creating as a sequence, and to clearly label what tasks are necessary for that sequence.

Making a thread is a workflow because the task "make a thread out of an existing conversation" is one that the end user does often, in order to achieve a variety of goals. 

Opening a new tab is a workflow because it is a task that one must do in order to accomplish a common, well defined goal. To be more precise with the definition of "workflow", a workflow is the way in which the end user modifies the application state in order to accomplish a goal.
